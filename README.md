This repository contains the Qanary ( **Q**uestion **an**swering vocabul**ary** vocabulary). The permanent URI of the ontolgy is:

<https://w3id.org/wdaqua/qanary#>

The Qanary vocabulary aims to define a vocabulary to express information that are generated during QA pipline about a question.

Consider for example the question "When was Barack Obama born?". Typical information generated by QA systems are the position of named entity (NE) (like "Barack Obama"), the relations of the ontology used to express the relational phrase in the question (that born refers to "dbo:birthPlace"), the expected answer (here a date), and the generated SPARQL query. Other such information are: the language of the question, possible ontologies that can be used to answer it or if a question is a text or audio file.

The Qanary vocabulary was introduced for the first time in:
