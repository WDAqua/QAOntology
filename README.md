# QAOntology

This repository contains the Qanary (**Q**uestion **an**swering vocabul**ary**) vocabulary. The permanent URI of the ontology is:

<https://w3id.org/wdaqua/qanary#>

The Qanary vocabulary aims to define a vocabulary to express information that are generated during the execution of a Question Answering (QA) pipeline on a question given as speech or text input.

Consider for example the question "When was Barack Obama born?". Typical information generated by components of a QA pipeline are the position of named entities (NE) (like "Barack Obama"), the relations of the ontology used to express the relational phrase in the question (that "born" refers to `dbo:birthPlace`), the expected answer (here: a date), and the generated SPARQL query. Other such information is: the language of the question, possible ontologies that can be used to answer it or if a question is a text or audio file.

The Qanary vocabulary was introduced for the first time in:

[Towards a Message-Driven Vocabulary for Promoting the Interoperability of Question Answering Systems](http://eis.iai.uni-bonn.de/upload/paper/2015___Towards_a_Message_Driven_Vocabulary_for_Promoting_the_Interoperability_of_Question_Answering_Systems.pdf), Kuldeep Singh and Andreas Both and Dennis Diefenbach and Saeedeh Shekarpour, Proc. of the 10th IEEE Int. Conf. on Semantic Computing (ICSC) 2016.
