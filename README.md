# QAOntology

This repository contains the *Qanary* (**Q**uestion **an**swering vocabul**ary**) vocabulary. The permanent URI of the ontology is:

<https://w3id.org/wdaqua/qanary#>

The Qanary vocabulary aims to define a vocabulary to express information that is generated during the execution of a Question Answering (QA) systems on a question given as speech, text input or any other input.

Consider for example the question "When was Barack Obama born?". Typical pieces of information generated by components (processing steps) of a QA system are the position of named entities (NE) (like "Barack Obama"), the relations of the ontology used to express the relational phrase in the question (that "born" refers to `dbo:birthPlace`), the expected answer (here: a date), and the generated SPARQL query. Other such information is the language of the question, possible ontologies that can be used to answer it or if a question is a text or audio file.

The Qanary vocabulary was introduced in the following publication. Please cite:
